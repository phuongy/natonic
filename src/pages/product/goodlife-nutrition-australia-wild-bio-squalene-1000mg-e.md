**The strength and longevity of the deep sea shark.**

**Shark Liver Oil?**

For centuries humans have respected the fearsome shark for its ferocity and brute strength. Only now however has the shark gained global attention in the scientific and medical community for its remarkable resistance to disease and the fact that cancer is exceedingly rare amongst sharks\[1].

Now what was used around the world as folk medicine for centuries is now available and prescribed by Doctors and Nutritionists in the form of Squalene.

Squalene is a natural compound which is vital for the synthesis of cholesterol, steroid hormones and vitamin D.

Goodlife Nutrition provides premium wild bio-squalene from deep sea sharks with the highest Australian quality standards. **Now in a 365 capsule bulk pack!**
